  "Text color #2A194C on background color #E9E9ED has insufficient contrast, making it difficult for users with visual impairments to read.",
  "Color is used alone to indicate required fields with the class 'required', which may not be perceivable to users with color blindness.",
  "There are no visible focus indicators on interactive elements like links and buttons, which can hinder keyboard navigation for users relying on keyboard input.",
  "Fixed font sizes are used throughout the CSS, which may prevent users from resizing text according to their needs, affecting readability.",
  "The use of absolute positioning for elements like the navigation menu and buttons may cause overlapping or hidden content, especially on smaller screens or with dynamic content.",
  "The CSS does not include any animations or flashing elements, but care should be taken to ensure that any future animations do not trigger seizures in users with photosensitive epilepsy.",
  "The design is somewhat responsive, but the use of fixed widths and floats may lead to usability issues on smaller devices, making it difficult for users to interact with content."
